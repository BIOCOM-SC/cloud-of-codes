## Research & Members
We are a group of research from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) that study diverse biological processes, e.g. from molecular level (ion channel function) to cell (motion, contraction), organ (heart beating) and population level (microbial proliferation, epidemiology). For that, we use different methods and perspectives with the goal of developing clinical applications for biomedicine and environmental applications for bioengineering.
